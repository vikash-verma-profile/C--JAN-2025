Create a Mini Library Management System


You are required to create a simple C++ program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage a small library. The program should perform the following tasks:

Define a class Book with the following attributes:

bookID (integer): Unique ID of the book.
title (string): Title of the book.
author (string): Author of the book.


Implement Member Functions:

A constructor to initialize the book details.
A function displayDetails() to print the book details.


Main Function Tasks:

Create an array of 3 books using the Book class.
Populate the array with data for three different books (use hardcoded values for simplicity).
Use a loop to display the details of all the books.

Constraints:
The program should demonstrate class and object creation.
The code must include at least one constructor and one member function.
Use appropriate access modifiers (private/public) to ensure encapsulation.
